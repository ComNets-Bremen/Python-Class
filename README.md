Python-Course repository
========================

In this repository, we offer the material for a Python programming class. The
idea is to offer an example-driven course. The interested student should go
through the examples given in the [examples](examples) directory of this
repository. In there, you will also find another Readme which will guide
you through the examples and give you the correct order.

### Download Python

This course focusses on **Python 3**. Please ensure that you install the
correction version!

* Linux: Preferably use the system repository (i.e., `sudo apt install python3`)
* Windows / Mac: https://www.python.org/downloads/
* For Linux, Windows, MacOS, Anaconda might be an option: https://www.anaconda.com

### Editors

For programming in Python, you need a text editor which is capable to store
plain text files (i.e. not tools as Libreoffice Writer or Microsoft Word). All
major operating systems some with such an editor (Notepad in case of Windows)
but it is worth having a look on more powerful editors like for example:

* Notepad++ (Windows): https://notepad-plus-plus.org
* Programmers Notepad (Windows): http://www.pnotepad.org/
* Eclipse (all): https://eclipse.org/
* Scite (all): http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html
* ...


### Tutorials

The Internet is full of programming tutorials. Here, we list a couple of them:

* Code Academy (Online): https://www.codecademy.com
* Think Python (PDF): http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.pdf
* Dive into Python (Online, PDF): http://www.diveintopython.net/
* wikibooks: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Subject:Python_programming_language
* Easy step-by-step tutorial: https://likegeeks.com/python-programming-basics/
* Official Python Docs: https://docs.python.org/2/
* Official Python Tutorial: https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html
* How to write good idiomatic Python: https://github.com/JeffPaine/beautiful_idiomatic_python/blob/master/README.md

### Online Interpreters

Some online Python interpreters exists. They are ideal for trying out simple
examples. However, for more complex code, they are overextended.
